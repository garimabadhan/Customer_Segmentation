# Customer_Segmentation
In this project, I worked on a real-world e-commerce sales data and segmented its customer base with Python, scikit-learn library and Plotly.

The workflow of the project is as follows:
1. Business Case
2. Data Preparation
3. Segmentation with K-means Clustering
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Visualization and Interpretation of the Results

Data points are shown in spheres and centroids of each group are shown with cubes. 4 customer groups are as follows:

Blue: Customers who ordered at least one product, with maximum total spending of 100 and having the highest average return rate. They might be the newcomers of the e-commerce website.

Red: Customers who ordered 1 to 4 products, with average total spending of 150 and a maximum return rate of 0.5.

Purple: Customers who ordered 1 to 4 products, with average total spending of 300 and a maximum return rate of 0.5.

Green: Customers who ordered 1 to 13 products, with average total spending of 600 and average return rate as 0. It makes the most favourable customer group for the company.
